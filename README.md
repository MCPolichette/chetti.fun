# Chetti.fun

## Basic Plan

This project is built arround the idea of building a fun little web app for my 3 year old daughter. Essentially I want to build a flexible framework, so that we can create new games as she ages.

## Goals

-   Host the website on my own domain (www.chetti.fun)
-   Build react based components so that new 'style' games can be developed over time
-   Provide a Fun, Ad Free, Safe for kids, Mobile environment.

### FIRST PROJECT

1.  Monster Builder
    This is the first intended game to design. The idea will be overlapping divs, to build a creature display. Once this project is completed, I can use the same concept to build 2 other similar style games with new components.

## Future ideas:

1. Robot Builder,
2. Kid dress-up - screenshot of face, and then paperdoll clothing.
3. Letter Identification game.
4. Experimenting with paper.js designs.
5. Dice Rolling Counting Game.
