# Chetti.fun

## Basic Plan
This project is built arround the idea of building a fun little web app for my 3 year old daughter.  Essentially I want to build a flexible framework, so that we can create new games as she ages.

## Goals
 - Host the website on my own domain (www.chetti.fun)
 - Build react based components so that new 'style' games can be developed over time
 - Provide a Fun, Ad Free, Safe for kids, Mobile environment.

### FIRST PROJECT
   1. Monster Builder
        This is the first intended game to design.  The idea will be overlapping divs, to build a creature display.  Once this project is completed, I can use the same concept to build 2 other similar style games with new components.

## Future ideas:
1. Robot Builder, 
2. Kid dress-up - screenshot of face, and then paperdoll clothing.
3. Letter Identification game.
4. Experimenting with paper.js designs.
6. Dice Rolling Counting Game.
